# BE-MGF

I have built a backend JSON Contacts Management API with PostgreSQL and Express using MVC pattern, which provides data and information to the front end.

You can access the application programmatically by fetching, posting, and updating contacts data through a client/user.

Link to front end : [here](https://github.com/Nayem59/FE-MGF)

To use and test this API please follow the steps below. Important Notes: You will need to have PostgreSQL v12.0 and Node.js v19.3.0 or later!

### Getting started

First clone this repository to your local machine and use `npm install ` to install all dependencies.

### Setting up the database

To set up and seed your database please run the following commands:

`npm run setup-dbs`

`npm run seed`

### Running the server

Please use the following command to run your server on localhost:9090 :

`npm run start`

### Running tests

I have used `Insomnia` to carry out all my tests for this exercise.
Please check the `app.js` file for the relevant endpoints.
